# TODO

## History

* "New conversation", and a history of conversations.
* Timestamp history entries.

## UX

* Animated spinner when translating.
* Quick help popup in source language?
* When input has focus, hide output, with a way to get it back?
* Kill the fucking auto-zoom!!!
* Confirmation modals when performing destructive operations on history.

## Administration / Product Feedback

* Log translation activity and errors somewhere...
* Access controls!
* Let user flag translations as good/bad.

## Issues

* Rendering on Safari mobile seems to assume a viewport that includes the address bar area, causing the page to render too long.
