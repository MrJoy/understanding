# Translation Spinner Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add an animated loading spinner to provide visual feedback while translations are being processed, improving perceived performance and user experience.

## Requirements
- Display spinner during translation API calls
- Provide smooth, non-jarring animation
- Maintain accessibility standards
- Handle error states appropriately

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Spinner Component Design
1. Create reusable Spinner component:
   - Use CSS animations for smooth performance
   - Consider SVG or pure CSS implementation
   - Make size and color customizable via props
2. Design options to consider:
   - Circular spinner (classic)
   - Dots animation
   - Pulse effect
   - Custom branded animation

### Step 2: Loading State Management
1. Add loading state to translation logic:
   - `isTranslating`: boolean flag
   - Set true when API call starts
   - Set false when response received or error occurs
2. Handle edge cases:
   - Rapid successive translations
   - Network timeout scenarios
   - User cancellation

### Step 3: UI Integration
1. Determine spinner placement:
   - Inside translate button
   - Over output text area
   - As overlay on entire translation section
   - In place of output text
2. Implement smooth transitions:
   - Fade in/out animation
   - Prevent layout shift
   - Maintain button/input states

### Step 4: Accessibility
1. Add ARIA attributes:
   - `aria-busy="true"` during loading
   - `aria-live` region for status updates
   - Screen reader announcements
2. Provide alternative feedback:
   - Loading text for screen readers
   - Keyboard focus management
   - Escape key to cancel

### Step 5: Error State Handling
1. Replace spinner with error indicator on failure
2. Provide clear error messages
3. Allow retry functionality
4. Maintain input text on error

### Step 6: Performance Optimization
1. Minimize spinner display for fast responses:
   - Add slight delay (e.g., 200ms) before showing
   - Keep spinner for minimum duration if shown
2. Use CSS transforms for animations (GPU acceleration)
3. Avoid JavaScript-based animations

### Step 7: User Experience Refinements
1. Disable translate button during loading
2. Prevent multiple simultaneous requests
3. Consider adding progress indication for long translations
4. Implement smooth transition from spinner to result
