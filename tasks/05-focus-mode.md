# Focus Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a focus mode that hides the output area when the input field has focus, maximizing screen space for text entry while providing an easy way to reveal the translation.

## Requirements
- Hide output when input receives focus
- Provide clear way to show output again
- Smooth transitions between states
- Mobile-friendly implementation

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Focus State Detection
1. Add focus event listeners to input textarea:
   - `onFocus`: trigger focus mode
   - `onBlur`: consider exit conditions
2. Track focus state in component:
   - `isInputFocused`: boolean state
   - `isFocusModeActive`: separate toggle state
3. Handle edge cases:
   - Tab navigation
   - Programmatic focus
   - Touch vs. mouse interactions

### Step 2: UI Layout Changes
1. Define focus mode layout:
   - Input area expands to full width/height
   - Output area slides out or fades
   - Minimize chrome/UI elements
2. Transition animations:
   - Smooth slide or fade effects
   - Avoid jarring layout shifts
   - Respect prefers-reduced-motion

### Step 3: Output Reveal Mechanism
1. Add reveal trigger button:
   - Floating action button
   - Tab or swipe gesture
   - Keyboard shortcut (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl+O)
2. Visual indicators:
   - Icon showing hidden output exists
   - Badge with translation status
   - Subtle animation to draw attention

### Step 4: Mobile Optimization
1. Handle virtual keyboard:
   - Adjust layout when keyboard appears
   - Ensure reveal button remains visible
   - Account for different keyboard heights
2. Touch gestures:
   - Swipe up to reveal output
   - Swipe down to hide again
   - Pinch to toggle modes

### Step 5: User Preferences
1. Add setting to control behavior:
   - Enable/disable focus mode
   - Choose trigger (automatic vs. manual)
   - Animation speed preference
2. Remember user choice:
   - Store in localStorage
   - Apply on page load
   - Sync across sessions

### Step 6: Interaction Refinements
1. Smart exit conditions:
   - Exit when translation completes
   - Stay focused during typing
   - Exit on explicit user action
2. Partial reveal option:
   - Show preview of output
   - Peek animation on hover
   - Split-screen mode option

### Step 7: Accessibility Considerations
1. Screen reader announcements:
   - Announce mode changes
   - Describe hidden content
   - Provide navigation hints
2. Keyboard navigation:
   - Tab order management
   - Focus trap prevention
   - Escape key to exit mode
