# Service Worker Auto-Update Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add functionality to automatically update the Understanding PWA when new versions are deployed, ensuring users always have the latest version without manual refresh.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users must manually refresh the app to get updates. This can lead to:
- Users running outdated versions
- Missing important bug fixes
- Inconsistent experience across users
- Potential compatibility issues

## Goals
1. Automatically detect when a new version is available
2. Download the update without interrupting the user
3. Notify the user that an update is ready
4. Apply the update at an appropriate time
5. Work reliably even with poor network conditions

## User Stories

### As a user:
- I want the app to stay updated automatically
- I want to be notified when updates are available
- I want to choose when to apply updates (not during active use)
- I want the app to work offline with cached data

### As a developer:
- I want to deploy updates knowing users will receive them
- I want to track update adoption rates
- I want clear error reporting if updates fail
- I want to version the app properly

## High-Level Approach

### Phase 1: Research & Planning
**Duration: 2 days**

Research tasks:
- Learn how service workers work in Next.js applications
- Understand PWA update lifecycle
- Research best practices for update UX patterns
- Evaluate tools/libraries (Workbox, next-pwa, custom implementation)

Deliverables:
- Technical design document with chosen approach
- List of required dependencies
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Phase 2: Basic Service Worker Setup
**Duration: 3 days**

Set up the foundation:
- Create service worker file structure
- Integrate with Next.js build process
- Implement basic caching for app assets
- Add version management system
- Set up development testing environment

Success criteria:
- Service worker registers successfully
- App works offline after first visit
- Can manually trigger update checks
- Old versions are cleaned up properly

### Phase 3: Update Detection System
**Duration: 2 days**

Build update detection:
- Implement periodic update checks (every 30 minutes)
- Detect when new version is available on server
- Download update in background
- Track download progress
- Handle download failures gracefully

Success criteria:
- Updates detected within 30 minutes of deployment
- Downloads don't impact app performance
- Failed downloads retry automatically
- Network usage is optimized

### Phase 4: User Notification System
**Duration: 2 days**

Create user-facing update flow:
- Design update notification UI (non-intrusive banner)
- Add "Update available" message
- Provide "Update now" and "Later" options
- Remember user preference for session
- Apply update on user action or next launch

Success criteria:
- Users see clear update notifications
- Can postpone updates without annoyance
- Updates apply smoothly without data loss
- UI remains consistent with app design

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
**Duration: 3 days**

Comprehensive testing:
- Test update flow on different devices
- Verify offline functionality
- Test with slow/unreliable networks
- Ensure translation history persists
- Test rollback scenarios

Success criteria:
- Works on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop browsers
- Updates work on 3G connections
- No data loss during updates
- Can handle failed updates gracefully

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Safari iOS (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

### Performance Requirements
- Update check: < 100ms impact on page load
- Background download: No visible performance impact
- Cache size: < 50MB total
- Update application: < 3 seconds

### Infrastructure Requirements
- HTTPS required (service workers only work on secure origins)
- Proper cache headers on static assets
- Version identifier in build output
- CDN cache invalidation strategy

## Key Decisions Needed

### Before Starting:
1. **Update Strategy**: How aggressive should automatic updates be?
   - Option A: Update immediately when available
   - Option B: Notify user and let them choose
   - Option C: Update on next app launch
   
2. **Versioning Scheme**: How do we version the app?
   - Option A: Use git commit hash
   - Option B: Use package.json version
   - Option C: Use build timestamp
   
3. **Cache Strategy**: What should we cache?
   - Option A: Everything (full offline support)
   - Option B: Core app only (partial offline)
   - Option C: Smart caching based on usage
   
4. **Library vs Custom**: Build from scratch or use library?
   - Option A: Use Workbox (Google's SW library)
   - Option B: Use next-pwa plugin
   - Option C: Custom implementation

### During Implementation:
1. How to handle users mid-translation when update arrives?
2. Should we pre-cache future features based on usage patterns?
3. How long to keep old versions before forcing update?
4. Should update notifications timeout and auto-apply?

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Service Worker Bugs
**Impact**: Could break app for all users
**Mitigation**: 
- Extensive testing before deployment
- Staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Kill switch to disable SW if needed
- Monitoring and alerts

### Risk 2: Storage Limitations
**Impact**: SW might fail on devices with low storage
**Mitigation**:
- Implement storage quota checks
- Clear old caches aggressively
- Provide manual cache clear option
- Fallback to network-only mode

### Risk 3: iOS Safari Limitations
**Impact**: Limited SW support on iOS
**Mitigation**:
- Test specifically on iOS devices
- Implement iOS-specific workarounds
- Document known limitations
- Provide manual refresh instructions

## Success Metrics
- 90% of users on latest version within 24 hours
- Zero reported data loss issues
- < 5% increase in support tickets
- Positive user feedback on update experience
- Improved app performance metrics

## Timeline Summary
- **Week 1**: Research, planning, and basic setup (5 days)
- **Week 2**: Update detection and notifications (4 days)
- **Week 3**: Testing and refinement (3 days)
- **Buffer**: 2-3 days for unexpected issues

**Total estimate: 12-15 days**

## Questions for Team Review
1. What's our tolerance for update delays (immediate vs next session)?
2. Do we need A/B testing capability for updates?
3. Should we support rolling back to previous versions?
4. What analytics do we need around update adoption?
5. How should we handle major breaking changes?

## Next Steps
1. Review this plan with team
2. Make key technical decisions
3. Set up test environment
4. Create detailed technical design
5. Begin Phase 1 implementation
