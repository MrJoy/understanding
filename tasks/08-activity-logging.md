# Activity Logging Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive logging for translation activity and errors to monitor app usage, debug issues, and improve service quality.

## Requirements
- Log translation requests and responses
- Capture errors and failures
- Store logs securely
- Provide analytics insights
- Maintain user privacy

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Logging Infrastructure
1. Choose logging approach:
   - Client-side temporary logs
   - Server-side persistent storage
   - Third-party service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
   - Hybrid approach
2. Set up logging service:
   - Structured logging format
   - Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Automatic timestamp
   - Session/request IDs

### Step 2: Translation Activity Logging
1. Log translation events:
   - Request initiated
   - Source/target languages
   - Text length (not content for privacy)
   - Response time
   - Success/failure status
2. Performance metrics:
   - API latency
   - Client processing time
   - Network conditions
3. User journey tracking:
   - Session duration
   - Translation frequency
   - Language pair usage

### Step 3: Error Logging
1. Capture error types:
   - API failures
   - Network errors
   - Client-side exceptions
   - Validation errors
2. Error context:
   - Stack traces
   - User actions leading to error
   - Browser/device information
   - Network status
3. Error categorization:
   - Severity levels
   - Error codes
   - Recovery attempts

### Step 4: Privacy and Security
1. Data sanitization:
   - Never log translation content
   - Hash or anonymize user identifiers
   - Exclude sensitive headers
   - Implement PII detection
2. Compliance considerations:
   - GDPR compliance
   - Data retention policies
   - User consent for analytics
   - Right to deletion

### Step 5: Storage Strategy
1. Client-side storage:
   - IndexedDB for temporary logs
   - Size limits and rotation
   - Batch upload to server
2. Server-side storage:
   - Database schema design
   - Log rotation policy
   - Backup strategy
   - Query optimization

### Step 6: Analytics Dashboard
1. Key metrics to track:
   - Daily active users
   - Translation volume
   - Error rates
   - Popular language pairs
   - Average response times
2. Visualization options:
   - Time series graphs
   - Heat maps
   - Error trend analysis
   - User flow diagrams

### Step 7: Monitoring and Alerts
1. Real-time monitoring:
   - Error spike detection
   - Performance degradation
   - Unusual activity patterns
2. Alert system:
   - Email notifications
   - Slack integration
   - Severity-based routing
   - Escalation procedures

### Step 8: Debug Tools
1. Developer features:
   - Log viewer in dev mode
   - Export logs for debugging
   - Filter and search capabilities
   - Reproduce issues from logs
2. Production debugging:
   - User session replay (privacy-safe)
   - Error grouping
   - Root cause analysis
