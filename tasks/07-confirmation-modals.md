# Confirmation Modals Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement confirmation modals for destructive operations on history to prevent accidental data loss and improve user confidence.

## Requirements
- Show confirmation before deleting conversations or history
- Clear messaging about what will be deleted
- Provide cancel option
- Follow platform conventions

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Modal Component Architecture
1. Create base Modal component:
   - Overlay/backdrop
   - Modal container
   - Focus trap
   - Escape key handling
2. Create ConfirmationModal variant:
   - Title
   - Message/description
   - Action buttons (Cancel/Confirm)
   - Optional danger styling

### Step 2: Identify Destructive Actions
1. List all destructive operations:
   - Delete single conversation
   - Delete multiple conversations
   - Clear all history
   - Delete single translation
   - Reset application data
2. Define confirmation requirements for each:
   - Severity level
   - Custom warning messages
   - Additional verification steps

### Step 3: Modal Trigger System
1. Create confirmation service:
   ```javascript
   confirmAction({
     title: "Delete Conversation?",
     message: "This will permanently delete this conversation and all its translations.",
     confirmText: "Delete",
     cancelText: "Cancel",
     isDangerous: true
   })
   ```
2. Return promise for action result
3. Handle modal queue for multiple confirmations

### Step 4: UI Design
1. Modal styling:
   - Centered overlay
   - Appropriate sizing
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Danger/warning colors for destructive actions
2. Button design:
   - Primary action styling
   - Danger button for destructive confirm
   - Clear cancel option
   - Loading state during action

### Step 5: Accessibility Features
1. Focus management:
   - Focus trap within modal
   - Return focus to trigger on close
   - Initial focus on cancel button
2. Screen reader support:
   - ARIA labels and descriptions
   - Role="dialog"
   - Announce modal opening
3. Keyboard navigation:
   - Tab between buttons
   - Escape to cancel
   - Enter to confirm (with safeguards)

### Step 6: Animation and Transitions
1. Entry animation:
   - Fade in backdrop
   - Scale or slide modal
   - Smooth appearance
2. Exit animation:
   - Fade out
   - Clean unmount
3. Handle rapid open/close

### Step 7: Confirmation Variations
1. Simple confirmation:
   - Basic yes/no
   - Single action
2. Detailed confirmation:
   - Show what will be deleted
   - Item count
   - Preview of affected data
3. Type-to-confirm:
   - For critical operations
   - User types "DELETE" to confirm
   - Prevents accidental clicks

### Step 8: Error Handling
1. Handle action failures:
   - Show error in modal
   - Allow retry
   - Provide error details
2. Network issues:
   - Offline handling
   - Timeout management
3. Partial failures:
   - Clear status reporting
   - Recovery options
