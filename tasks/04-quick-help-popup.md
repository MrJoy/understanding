# Quick Help Popup Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a quick help popup that displays in the user's source language, providing contextual assistance and tips for using the translation app effectively.

## Requirements
- Help content displays in user's selected source language
- Non-intrusive popup design
- Context-sensitive help information
- Easy to dismiss and access

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Help Content Structure
1. Define help topics:
   - Basic usage instructions
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Language switching
   - History navigation
   - Tips for better translations
2. Create multilingual content:
   - English help content
   - Japanese help content (日本語のヘルプ)
   - Structure for easy addition of more languages
3. Organize content by context:
   - Input area help
   - Output area help
   - Settings help
   - History help

### Step 2: Popup Component Design
1. Create HelpPopup component:
   - Floating card design
   - Semi-transparent backdrop option
   - Smooth fade in/out animations
   - Position near trigger element
2. Design considerations:
   - Mobile-responsive layout
   - Readable typography
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Consistent with app design language

### Step 3: Trigger Mechanism
1. Add help trigger button:
   - Question mark icon (?)
   - Positioned in toolbar or corner
   - Keyboard shortcut (e.g., Shift+?)
2. Implement hover tooltips:
   - Brief hints on hover
   - Click for detailed help
3. First-time user detection:
   - Auto-show on first visit
   - Option to never show again

### Step 4: Language Detection and Switching
1. Detect current source language setting
2. Load appropriate help content
3. Update help language when source language changes
4. Fallback to English if translation unavailable

### Step 5: Content Management
1. Store help content structure:
   ```
   {
     "en": {
       "input": "Type or paste text here...",
       "shortcuts": "Press Ctrl+Enter to translate"
     },
     "ja": {
       "input": "ここにテキストを入力...",
       "shortcuts": "Ctrl+Enterで翻訳"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Create content loading system
3. Implement markdown support for rich formatting

### Step 6: Interaction Design
1. Dismiss mechanisms:
   - Click outside to close
   - X button in corner
   - ESC key to dismiss
2. Prevent accidental dismissal:
   - Delay before allowing dismiss
   - Confirmation for "Don't show again"
3. Navigation within help:
   - Tabs or sections for different topics
   - Search within help content

### Step 7: Analytics and Improvement
1. Track help usage:
   - Which sections viewed most
   - How long users spend in help
   - Common search queries
2. A/B test different help formats
3. Collect feedback on help usefulness
