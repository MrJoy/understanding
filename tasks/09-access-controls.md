# Access Controls Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement access control mechanisms to manage who can use the translation service and what features they can access, ensuring security and proper resource allocation.

## Requirements
- User authentication system
- Role-based permissions
- API rate limiting
- Usage quotas
- Administrative controls

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Authentication System
1. Choose authentication method:
   - Email/password
   - OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
   - Magic links
   - API keys for programmatic access
2. Implement auth flow:
   - Registration process
   - Login/logout
   - Password reset
   - Session management
   - Remember me functionality

### Step 2: User Roles and Permissions
1. Define role hierarchy:
   - Guest (limited access)
   - Free user (basic features)
   - Premium user (full features)
   - Admin (system management)
2. Permission matrix:
   ```
   Feature          | Guest | Free | Premium | Admin
   ----------------|-------|------|---------|-------
   Translations/day |   5   | 100  |  1000   | âˆž
   History access  |   No  | Yes  |   Yes   | Yes
   Export data     |   No  | No   |   Yes   | Yes
   API access      |   No  | No   |   Yes   | Yes
   Admin panel     |   No  | No   |   No    | Yes
   ```

### Step 3: Rate Limiting
1. Implement rate limits:
   - Requests per minute
   - Translations per day
   - Character count limits
2. Rate limit storage:
   - Redis for distributed systems
   - In-memory for single instance
3. Rate limit headers:
   - X-RateLimit-Limit
   - X-RateLimit-Remaining
   - X-RateLimit-Reset

### Step 4: Usage Tracking
1. Track user metrics:
   - Translation count
   - Character count
   - API calls
   - Storage usage
2. Quota enforcement:
   - Soft limits (warnings)
   - Hard limits (blocking)
   - Grace period handling
3. Usage dashboard:
   - Current usage display
   - Historical trends
   - Quota warnings

### Step 5: API Key Management
1. API key generation:
   - Secure random generation
   - Key rotation capability
   - Expiration dates
2. Key permissions:
   - Scoped access
   - IP restrictions
   - Domain whitelist
3. Key dashboard:
   - View active keys
   - Usage statistics
   - Revoke keys

### Step 6: Admin Panel
1. User management:
   - View all users
   - Modify roles
   - Ban/suspend accounts
   - Reset passwords
2. System monitoring:
   - Active sessions
   - Usage statistics
   - Error logs
   - Performance metrics
3. Configuration:
   - Adjust rate limits
   - Modify quotas
   - Feature flags
   - Maintenance mode

### Step 7: Security Measures
1. Account security:
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Login attempt limiting
   - Device tracking
2. Data protection:
   - Encryption at rest
   - Secure token storage
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - CORS configuration

### Step 8: Billing Integration (if applicable)
1. Subscription management:
   - Plan selection
   - Payment processing
   - Invoice generation
   - Auto-renewal
2. Usage-based billing:
   - Overage charges
   - Prepaid credits
   - Usage alerts
3. Payment security:
   - PCI compliance
   - Secure payment flow
   - Fraud detection
